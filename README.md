# Bang! Bang!

In this project, I'm re-creating Bang! Bang!, the Windows 95 game.

## Useful Commands

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Right now, the only command that I'm interested on is `npm start`.
This command will start the development server with hot-reloading.

More commands (the default ones provided by create-react-app) can be found in their documentation.
